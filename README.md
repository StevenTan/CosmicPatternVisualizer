# Cosmic Harmonica - the fusion of art and science

### About:

While the primary aim is to help users learn about physics concepts such as rotational speed and orbital radius, this playground also has a broader mission - to shift societal perceptions to understand the importance of art in our daily lives.

### Design Rationale:

In the latter part of the playground, I encourage kids and users to let their imaginations run wild, embracing the freedom of artistic thinking. Here, the playground inspires them to craft geometrical patterns using physics concepts they've learned. By manipulating orbital speed and radius, they gain a deeper understanding of how these factors affect the formation of geometric patterns, bridging the gap between physics, mathematics, and art.

## Itâ€™s one Swift Playground, but limitless possibilities:
* First, they learn the actual science facts, including the mathematics behind the formation of flower patterns through the dance of Venus and Earth.
* Then, they get the chance to apply the physics knowledge they've just learnt, combined with their creativity, to create art.

## ðŸŽ¨ Using science to create ARTS 
* By adjusting the colors of the lines and the rotational speeds of the celestial bodies...

## ðŸŽ¼ Using science to create MUSIC
* By experimenting with different orbital speeds, have you noticed the formation of the 4th and 5th harmonics?
